# Incognito Pay Kit for iOS
With the Incognito Pay Kit for iOS, iOS developers are able to enhance their app features and provide their users with more financial and privacy options. Users can now make and receive payment in cryptocurrency while staying anonymous.  With the blockchain behind Incognito Pay Kit for iOS being powered by Incognito https://incognito.org, cryptocurrency transactions can now be done anonymously. Whether users are used to making payments with cryptocurrency or it’s their first time, Incognito Pay Kit for iOS will definitely work for them. Work is in progress as we at NDNCMNKY keep looking for ways to improve this unique product and user experience. In addition, we have also developed a fork of Signal messenger app https://github.com/IncognitoPayKit/Signal-iOS which will be available in iOS app store soon.
